# Roller Madness !

## About

This is one of my first attempts at building a game using **Unity3D** and **C#**, built during the course of the online program **"Introduction to Game Development"** by the **Michigan State University** and taught by **Brian Winn**.

This game constantly under development and is yet very far from perfect, but still pretty playable. Any and all suggestions are welcome.

## Gameplay

The player controls a ball in a three dimensional world that is moved to collect randomnly spawning coins while navigating through obstacles.
All this while, contact with enemy boxes needs to be avoided. The enemies can only be destroyed by bringing them in contact with each other.
The game finishes when the players falls off the stage, or touches an enemy box.

## How to play
I have included a **WebGL** build for people to run on their browsers.
It works on **Firefox**, but be warned though, that WebGL might not work on Chrome.

## Technologies employed
* Unity3D 5.4
* C#

## Credits
The sound effects of the game were provided by Brian Winn.
